## How It Works

This is a static website that can be used as a reference tool. It's built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Users can browse different web development topics and view code snippets for each one. Each code snippet modal includes a copy button that allows users to copy the code to their clipboard. 

The layout of the site adapts to various screen sizes using Bootstrap's responsive grid system. All logic is handled client-side with vanilla JavaScript.
